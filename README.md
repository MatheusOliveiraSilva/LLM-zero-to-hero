This repository is designed for individuals with a basic computer science background who want to develop, refine, and deepen their understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) and NLP techniques. Here, you'll find a structured, step-by-step learning path that will help you transform scattered knowledge into a coherent, well-organized skill set.

- Learn about common data cleaning techniques and why they matter.

**Practical Exercises:**  
- Perform text cleaning on a raw corpus (e.g., a simple text file or a short article).  
- Implement tokenization, remove stopwords, and generate n-grams.  
- Discuss how different languages and domains might require different preprocessing strategies.

### Chapter 2: Modern Tokenization and Introduction to Embeddings  
**Concepts:**  
- Subword tokenization methods (BPE, WordPiece) and their advantages over traditional word-based tokenization.  
- Basic understanding of embeddings (no training needed yet, just conceptual).

**Theory & Discussion:**  
- Why do we need subword tokenization? (Handle rare words, reduce vocabulary size, etc.)  
- What are embeddings? How do they differ from one-hot encodings?

**Practical Exercises:**  
- Use Hugging Face tokenizers to compare outputs of traditional and modern tokenization methods.  
- Examine how a pretrained model’s tokenizer splits a given text.  
- Experiment with different texts and observe differences in tokenization granularity.

### Chapter 3: Introduction to Transformers and Pre-Trained Models  
**Concepts:**  
- Transformer architecture basics (attention mechanisms, encoder-decoder structure).  
- Introduction to pre-trained models (BERT, GPT-2, DistilGPT-2) and their common use cases.

**Theory & Discussion:**  
- Understand the role of attention in Transformers and how it replaced RNN-based models in many NLP tasks.  
- Learn about masked language modeling vs. causal language modeling and why it matters for downstream tasks.

**Practical Exercises:**  
- Load a small pre-trained Transformer model (e.g., DistilGPT-2) locally.  
- Generate some text given a prompt using CPU inference.  
- Experiment with different prompts and observe how the model’s output changes.

### Chapter 4: Inference and Basic Optimizations  
**Concepts:**  
- Differences between CPU, GPU, and TPU for NLP tasks.  
- Quantization (8-bit, 4-bit) to speed up inference and reduce memory usage.  
- Trade-offs between model size, speed, and quality.

**Theory & Discussion:**  
- Why is inference slow on CPUs with large models?  
- How does quantization affect model precision and quality?

**Practical Exercises:**  
- Apply a simple quantization technique using bitsandbytes or transformers methods.  
- Measure inference time before and after quantization.  
- Try different quantization levels and note their impact on generation quality.

### Chapter 5: Conventional Fine-Tuning  
**Concepts:**  
- Why do we fine-tune? Tailoring a pre-trained model to a specific task or domain.  
- The workflow of fine-tuning: dataset preparation, splitting into train/validation/test sets, choosing hyperparameters, and evaluation metrics (accuracy, F1-score).

**Theory & Discussion:**  
- Explore the importance of choosing the right hyperparameters and avoiding overfitting.  
- Understand evaluation protocols and the differences between training, validation, and test splits.

**Practical Exercises:**  
- Fine-tune a BERT-like model on a sentiment classification dataset in Google Colab with GPU support.  
- Experiment with varying learning rates and epochs.  
- Evaluate the model’s performance on a validation set and interpret the results.

### Chapter 6: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) and LoRA  
**Concepts:**  
- Motivation behind PEFT: reducing the number of trainable parameters for resource efficiency.  
- Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and how it enables quick, cost-effective fine-tuning.

**Theory & Discussion:**  
- Compare traditional full-parameter fine-tuning with PEFT approaches in terms of memory and compute.  
- Understand scenarios where PEFT is particularly beneficial.

**Practical Exercises:**  
- Apply LoRA to a small pre-trained model and compare training time and memory usage with full fine-tuning.  
- Check model quality differences and discuss the trade-offs.

### Chapter 7: Exploring LLaMA-like Models and Large LLMs  
**Concepts:**  
- Introduction to large LLMs (LLaMA, LLaMA2, Falcon, BLOOM) and their hardware requirements.  
- Challenges of running and fine-tuning large models locally (RAM, GPU constraints).

**Theory & Discussion:**  
- Understand scaling laws: how model performance scales with size and training data.  
- Explore why quantization is critical for large models in CPU-bound environments.

**Practical Exercises:**  
- Run inference on a LLaMA-like model quantized to 4-bit using `llama.cpp`.  
- Conduct a lightweight LoRA fine-tuning on a small subset of data in Colab, noting the resources and time required.

### Chapter 8: Prompting and Quality Refinement  
**Concepts:**  
- Prompt engineering: formatting instructions and context to guide model behavior.  
- Improving qualitative outputs without retraining (prompt tuning).

**Theory & Discussion:**  
- Understand how the initial context affects generation and how to iteratively refine prompts.  
- Consider the concept of “chain-of-thought” prompts and their effect on reasoning quality.

**Practical Exercises:**  
- Provide various prompts to a model and compare the quality of generated answers.  
- Develop a small prompt set and evaluate model responses qualitatively.  
- Experiment with few-shot prompting and observe the improvements in task performance.

### Chapter 9: End-to-End Project - Building an NLP/LLM Application  
**Concepts:**  
- Integrating all learned components: data collection, preprocessing, tokenization, fine-tuning, and deployment.  
- Documentation, version control, and reproducibility in machine learning projects.

**Theory & Discussion:**  
- Consider the entire lifecycle of an LLM-based application.  
- Understand how to ensure repeatability, maintainability, and scalability of your workflows.

**Practical Exercises:**  
- Choose a simple use case (e.g., generating domain-specific answers or custom classification).  
- Build a small dataset, apply LoRA fine-tuning, and run inference.  
- Document the entire pipeline, from data preparation to model evaluation, and record all decisions and outcomes.

### Chapter 10: Exploring Cutting-Edge Techniques  
**Concepts:**  
- Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF).

**Theory & Discussion:**  
- Learn what’s beyond classic fine-tuning: guided improvements through human feedback.  
- Understand the next frontier: LLMs capable of understanding and producing multiple input types.

**Practical Suggestions:**  
- Read recent papers and blog posts about RLHF and instruction tuning.  
- If possible, run small experiments with open-source RLHF frameworks.  
- Explore multimodal examples, if resources and time permit.
